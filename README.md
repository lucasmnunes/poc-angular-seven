# poc-angular-seven
A brief configuration POC about Angular 7

# Goal
This project was created mainly to find out the file structure generated by the Angular CLI (7.3.8) during creation of any Angular 7 project. With this, it's possible to compare this structure with other structures generated from older Angular versions.
